This paper showcases the pros and cons of blockchain system. Cryptocurrencies use the blockchain 
system, With the unfathomable rise of bitcoin in the last decade, blockchain technology and crypto 
currencies have gained popularity. However, with this new fame, notoriety has also been built. 
Crypto currencies have been commonly associated as unreliable and unscrupulous. With the 
advancements of technology, data has become vastly more important. The security and authenticity 
of our data has become increasingly necessary. Moreover, the speed at which data is transferred. 
This paper attempts to explore the challenges blockchain technology faces from being more 
commonplace, and reasons why blockchain technology should be used in the first place.

Does Blockchain technology and Cryptocurrencies have a place in the future?

With the sudden increase of popularity in crypto technologies, many adversities have arose. 
The mass press on cryptocurrency being a volatile and chaotic digital currency with no tangible value 
and the gross fraudulent schemes, has given crypto currency and blockchain a notorious public 
image. An example of this is Logan Paul’s ‘CryptoZoo scam’, where he “pledged to refund investors 
$1.8 million”, and hasn’t paid back anyone after “ 9 months “ of announcing his pledge. (The 
Economic Times, Oct 09, 2023). Similarly, Founder of FTX and Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-
Fried was found guilty of fraud after taking customer’s assets and using them for “risky trades” (D. 
Brian Blank, Brandy Hadley, Nov. 7 2023).  This and similar incidents in the crypto-world have 
severely impacted the public’s perception of cryptocurrencies, instilling a distrust in them. However, 
blockchain goes beyond cryptocurrency (a means for storing capital). This paper will explain how 
cryptocurrencies and blockchain work and why they could play significant role in the future. 
Multistep transactions requiring verification and traceability can be made easier with the use of 
blockchain technology. It can expedite data transfer procedures, guarantee safe transactions, and 
reduce compliance costs. Blockchain technology can help with product auditing and contract 
management. Effectively lowering costs and increasing profit margins.

“A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes“ 
(Adamy Hayes, April 23 2023). Imagine blockchain technology as an open database, where every 
transaction ever done is recorded. Since, transactions may be done without a central authority and 
also can be instead be validated by a network of computer nodes that run blockchain software, 
making blockchain technology very appealing. This is crucial for digital currencies, enabling secure 
decentralized transactions.( Blockchain Revolution: Beyond Bitcoin and into the Future, Sep 07, 2023) 
However, blockchain doesn’t only have to be a means to store wealth, but store information (such as 
medical records, government records, legal contracts, etc.). This can mean a reduction in costs and 
quicker data flows, removing middlemen. Blockchain could help to tackle banking, cyber security, 
management, healthcare and government issues (Sana Afreen, Jul. 21 2023). For instance, blockchain 
technology could help to provide instantaneous and borderless transactions. Because blockchain 
relies on peer-to-peer connections that prevent data manipulation, it can detect malicious attacks 
fast. The block chain ledger is verified by comparing it to every user’s version of the blockchain. 
Hackers can attack government and organisation’s databases, such as the Equifax 2017 data breach 
affecting “147 million people” (Federal Trade Commission, December 2022). Using cryptographic 
techniques (asymmetric-key algorithms, and hash functions), every single piece of data saved on the 
blockchain network is encrypted, preventing hackers. Blockchain offers a transparent and 
trustworthy method of recording transactions by not following a single system (not giving your 
private information to anyone). This could greatly benefit people who do not have bank accounts, as 
“1.3 billion adults” “currently save, remit or pay bills in cash” (The World Bank, 2020) – enabling 
equal opportunities for all regardless of background, gender, ethnicity or country. Bitcoin peaked at 
2021 with “$68,789.63” (Brian Nibley, 1 Mar 2023) and it slowing decreasing in value onwards, with 
peaks in 2022 – “$48,086.84” and 2023 “$16,674”. [figure 1]
This evidently illustrates a negative trend for bitcoin (one of the biggest cryptocurrencies), and 
cryptocurrencies as a whole. 	


What is holding blockchain technology back? The problems are: lack of adoption by 
organizations, the need of highly skilled workers, financing projects, regulations, 
interoperability. Blockchain technology requires a high energy demand, devices on the 
Bitcoin network consumes more energy annually compared to Pakistan (Investopedia, 
Cambridge University). The struggle of whether energy is available and cost effective is 
largely considered in the technology field. Blockchain is very new technology still in the 
developmental stages. Projects require a great amount of skill and financing due to the 
complexity of blockchain technology. Additionally, interoperability  (the potential for data 
sharing, viewing and access) will be another challenge for Blockchain, as blockchain systems 
are created with their own systems and rules, it is harder to adopt. Education is the biggest 
challenge blockchain technology faces currently. Due to the shear complexity and recency of 
blockchain technology (with bitcoin only being officially released in 2009).

Conclusion:

Bitcoin saw an unheard-of surge in 2017; at one time, one BTC was worth more than $19,000. However, 
there was a significant collapse in the price of Bitcoin in January 2018, with a mere 65% 
drop in value in that month alone. Many individuals appeared to lose faith in blockchain 
technology following this upswing and downswing, solely connecting it to one particular 
kind of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin). Nonetheless, it is clear that blockchain technology 
has a wide variety of applications across several industries. The blockchain has a lot of 
intriguing applications, and these will only get more numerous as time goes on.
