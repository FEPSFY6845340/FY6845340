      This paper showcases the blockchain system. Crypto currency has a very volatile value - ranging from penny coins to bitcoin.
      Bitcoin and Etherum were once thought to be controversial and had very distinct peaks and crashes. However looking at the data
      in the past 3 years, bitcoin and etherum have now stabilised to a degree. Whilst penny coins and token coins are highly volatile,
      making money with these are a steep gamble. As coins such as doge or luna have had dramatic steep crashes and peaks.

      INTRO:
      
      “Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an 
        intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of 
        learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample 
      candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential 
      to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by 
      Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty 
      sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller, 
      2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are 
      presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class 
      labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is 
      subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of 
      learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as 
      reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the 
      classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).”
